@title Welcome to ErlyMUD
@doc ErlyMUD is a rather minimalistic MUD server, written in Erlang and 
making use of the excellent OTP libraries. The aim is to have solid support 
for exploration and roleplaying, within a highly fault-tolerant environment 
where system crashes or reboots are more of an exotic curiosity than a 
commonplace thing.
