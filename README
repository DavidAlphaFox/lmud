So what's this? Well, not very much at all yet.. The beginnings of a MUD
server implemented in Erlang, written for the fun of it, and as an exercise
for me to learn Erlang/OTP.

Current status:

* Will accept telnet connections on port 1155, where everything written
  simply gets echoed back at you. Except for "quit" which, for convenience,
  drops the connection.

* Works nicely with release_manager; code upgrades can indeed happen
  online, if there are no other factors involved that will prevent it.

That's all really. Better documentation might happen sooner or later,
if this project doesn't die off ;)
