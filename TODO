ErlyMUD TODO
============

0.2.4
-----
* Clean up the code
* Make use of print_except() instead of print_while()
* Move save file handling to em_game and put files in a better location,
  so they won't be tied to the specific version of the erlymud app

Future
------
* Idle timer in 'who' list
* Put the {In, Out} "client" Pid pair into a record definition for clarity?
* Implement items/objects
* Put new parser in place
* Make "action server" that performs stuff on behalf of living, where we
  can implement delays and print back to living without deadlock worries
  - but how does this work together with, for example, calling cmd_look()
    during login? sequencing and all that..
* Better support for the telnet protocol
