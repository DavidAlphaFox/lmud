ErlyMUD TODO
============

* Fix TCP input handling so that original case of input line is preserved
  separately? Would be useful in 'tell' etc.
* Modify 'look' so you see other people in the same room.
* Modify movement commands (north/east/south/west) so they display
  a message to the room as well when someone leaves or enters.
* Modify em_game:login() to display a message to the room when someone
  logs in to the game.
* Add more specific print_except() function to em_room? Will take a list
  of livings to exclude.. This one's often used.
* Make all print functions calls, not casts
