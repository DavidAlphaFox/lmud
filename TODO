============

* Fix TCP input handling so that original case of input line is preserved
  separately? Would be useful in 'tell' etc.
* Add more specific print_except() function to em_room? Will take a list
  of livings to exclude.. This one's often used.
* Separate process for output? To be able to use call for print, but avoid
  locks due to being in input processing phase..
* Implement passwords and savefiles?
* Make the em_conn be the "user"?
