============

* Fix TCP input handling so that original case of input line is preserved
  separately? Would be useful in 'tell' etc.
* Add more specific print_except() function to em_room? Will take a list
  of livings to exclude.. This one's often used.
* Implement passwords and savefiles?
* Make the em_conn be the "user"?
* Put the {In, Out} "client" Pid pair into a record definition for clarity?
