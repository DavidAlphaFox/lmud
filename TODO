ErlyMUD TODO
============

0.2.4
-----
* Clean up the code;
  - Fix issue with room setup; if em_game restarts, it loses state and
    doesn't think there are any rooms.. but they are still active below
    em_room_sup!
* Move save file handling to em_game and put files in a better location,
  so they won't be tied to the specific version of the erlymud app

Future
------
* Improve connection lifecycle;
  - If an em_living dies;
    * Then em_user can inform about it, then run a do_login() again to get
      a new living
    * Also the em_room must clean out the original living id
    * Not to mention em_game, same there?
  - If an em_user dies;
    * Then em_conn can create a new one and put it into login phase, just
      like when someone connects
    * The em_game should clean up also
    * The em_living should get a timer, say 60 seconds, and if not reconnected
      after that time it should stop
    * When user logs in again, reconnect it to the em_living and the game
* Idle timer in 'who' list
* Put the {In, Out} "client" Pid pair into a record definition for clarity?
* Implement items/objects
* Put new parser in place
* Make "action server" that performs stuff on behalf of living, where we
  can implement delays and print back to living without deadlock worries
  - but how does this work together with, for example, calling cmd_look()
    during login? sequencing and all that..
* Better support for the telnet protocol
