ErlyMUD TODO
============

0.2.2
-----
* Hide password input during login
* Add emote command
* Fix TCP input handling so that original case of input line is preserved
  separately, useful in 'tell' etc.
* Make entering / leaving the game show in the room
* Make leaving the game announce to everyone as a notice

Future
------
* Add more specific print_except() function to em_room? Will take a list
  of livings to exclude.. This one's often used.
* Put the {In, Out} "client" Pid pair into a record definition for clarity?
* Move login stuff etc into separate em_user module
* Implement items/objects
* Put new parser in place
