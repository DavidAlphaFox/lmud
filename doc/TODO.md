TODO
====

This is the new TODO list. See the bottom of this document for the
old TODO.


Usability
---------

* [x] Add readline support (done via rlwrap)
* [ ] Convert stdout messages to log messages, conditional on debug setting


Command Parsing
---------------

Support the following usage workflow:

1. [x] Enter a command in the MUD
1. [x] The command is checked against a list of aliases
1. [x] If matched, the actual command is used instead of the alias
1. [x] Command and args are parsed
1. [x] Appropriate mod:finc + args is called
1. [x] Results of call are printed to terminal session

Support the following development workflow:

* [x] Base commands as well as aliases have metadata for which group of
      commands they belong to (useful for printing help and extended help
      for commands)
* [x] A base module exists which has a list of all supported commands +
      help text + mod:func they dispatch to
* [x] A new module is created with a list of aliases + actual command names
* [x] A data amalgamation function is updated to include calling the data
      function of the new module, adding its aliases/commands to the list of
      command data
* [x] A parsing function pulls in the base commands as well as all the
      defined aliases in the alias modules and the aliases are mapped to
      actual mod:func
* [x] parse_cmd checks the passed command (from user input) against this data
      structure to see if alias, if base command, which mod:func to call
* [ ] BUG - when calling an alias, pass (and marge) the alias args to the
      command args

Support the following command-related commands

* [x] help (and aliases) - display base commands only
* [x] help aliases - display all aliases, grouped by type (e.g., IRC, WoW,
      etc.)
* [x] help commands - display aliases as well as base commands
* [ ] a function will be needed to list the command, it's help, its
      destination module, it's destination function, the lowest permission
      role allowed in order to call it, and maybe its aliases as well ...
* [ ] possibly an is-alias function?


Breakout and Dependencies
-------------------------

* [ ] Add lager for use in debugging
* [ ] Look at using a plugin system
  * Heinz has written one here: https://github.com/Licenser/eplugin
    * this uses different mechanisms than the one that lfetool defines
  * port to LFE as lplug?
    * provide the option of either using ETS tables like eplugin, or
    * use behaviors and ``beam_lib`` calls
* [ ] Remote shell generalization
  * Move telnet shell into own project
  * is there another telnet shell we could use a dependency?
    * otp /lib/common_test/test/telnet_server.erl?
  * add support for an SSH MUD server via ssh_sshd?
    * what would it take to modify ssh_sshd?
* [x] move mud_parser into its own repo/project
  * add as a dependency
* [x] add erlang color as a dep:
  * https://github.com/julianduque/erlang-color
  * [x] replace custom color macros
* [x] Move lib/erlymud into top-level dir


Commands
--------

* [ ] add a god-level permission for granting god permissions in-game
* [ ] add a wizard-level permission for granting wizard permissions in-game
* [ ] split up wizard commands and regular commands
* add commands for:
  [ ] setting up finance
  [ ] markets
  [ ] trade
  [ ] auctions


Colorizing
----------

Update outputs with the following colors:

* [ ] Wall -> red
* [ ] Yelling -> red (bold)
* [x] Notification -> blue
  * [ ] one of the "notice" messages isn't getting coloured (logging out)
* [x] whisper -> magenta
* [x] say -> yellow
* [x] emote -> yellow (bold)
* [x] leave & arrive messages -> yellow (bold)
* [x] think -> black (bold); really grey
* [x] room title -> green (bold)


Game Data
---------

Game data is currently written to files; we should moved to a database
instead. Before doing that, though, it might be nice to put all data
read/write functions in a common module:

* [x] create a new filestore module
* [x] update "living" code to use it
* [x] update login code to use it
* [x] update object code to use it
* [x] update room code to use it
* [x] update user code to use it

Desired features for existing code:

* [ ] Add support for saving room state (dropping things in a room and then
      restaring the game causes the dropped items to be lost).

With the read/write code abstracted out to a sigle module, it will be easier
to swap out with something in the future. Perhaps along these lines:

* [ ] Migrate game data to ETS table(s)
* [ ] Add support to flushing to disk (DETS)
* [ ] Add support for Mnesia
* [ ] Add support for creating rooms that get written to the DB
* [ ] Load rooms on start from DB


Talking
-------

* [ ] Add support for WALL
* [ ] Add support for YELL (nearest rooms only)
* [ ] Add support for EMIT/MSG
* [ ] Add public channel
* [ ] Add support for talking on a public channel
* [ ] Add channel for every guild
* [ ] Add support for talking on a guild channel


NPCs
----

* [ ] add NCP abstraction
* [ ] add simple conversation to NPCs
* [ ] add Elizabot "AI" to NPCs
* [ ] add support for specialized NPCs
* Add specialized NPCs:
  * [ ] add banker
  * [ ] add shopkeeper
  * [ ] add auctioneer


Permissions
-----------

For a massive MUD, there will likely need to be a greater number of
permissions. Possible permission levels:

* complete world control:
  * creating rooms/tunnels/open spaces/etc,
  * creating creatures
  * name: Deva? Valar? Aesir?
  * command prefix: d@- ?
* world-modification and defying laws of physics:
  * creating things, teleporting people/things, changing rooms/etc.
  * name: wizard
  * command prefix: w@- ?
* control over worlds' commodities, goods, money, markets:
  * name: Asura?
  * command prefix: a@- ?
* NPC
* Player


Groups
------

* Add support for Guilds
  * [ ] come up with a mechanism for players to create guilds
  * [ ] put guild in "petition" queue
  * [ ] with enough signatures by people who *aren't* currently in a guild,
        move to "approved" queue
  * [ ] provide a means of wizards overriding the guild status and moving
        to a different queue or moving to "active" status


Mapping Areas

TBD


Creating Buildings
------------------

TBD


World Items
-----------

TBD


In-Game Trade
-------------

TBD


Migration to LFE
----------------

* [x] include LFE as a dep
* [ ] all new functionality, write in LFE
  * [x] port newly-added em_util to lmud-util
* [x] rename to lmud or Î»MUD
* continue to use em_* Erlang modules (as legacy)
  * slowly port these to LFE, as time and interest allows
* [x] use this ASCII:

Old TODO
========


0.3.4
-----
* Add typespecs, documentation for (at least) API functions
  -status: continue with em_room
* Write some tests?


0.3.5
-----
* Add item building commands
  - oedit: Edit / Create Objects
* Fix so that failure to load start room puts you in safe room
* Add 'goto' command for admins, to move to other rooms
* Add 'transfer' command for admins, to move another player
* Extend support for navigation and communication
  - n/e/s/w for movement
  - '/" for say, : for emote
  - nod/smile/grin/shrug/..
* Idle timer in 'who' list


Future
------
* Improve password hashing security
  - at least use password + secret
  - or look at implementing HMAC?
* Test fix for leaking processes when load_living() fails, etc
  - see em_rh_login:do_login()
* Work on cmd_* implementations to improve error handling etc
  - 'redit' / 'addexit' should check validity of direction
* Send IAC GA sequence after printing prompts?
* Put new parser in place
* Use 'areas' for organizing rooms and objects
* Add 'destroy' command for destroying objects in own inventory?
* Add 'clone' command for instantiating object templates
* Shutdown / reboot command
* Improve connection lifecycle;
  - If an em_living dies;
    * Then em_user can inform about it, then run a do_login() again to get
      a new living
    * Also the em_room must clean out the original living id
    * Not to mention em_game, same there?
  - If an em_user dies;
    * Then em_conn can create a new one and put it into login phase, just
      like when someone connects
    * The em_game should clean up also
    * The em_living should get a timer, say 60 seconds, and if not reconnected
      after that time it should stop
    * When user logs in again, reconnect it to the em_living and the game
* Put the {In, Out} "client" Pid pair into a record definition for clarity?
